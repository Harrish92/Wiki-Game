# Wikipedia-Game
This is a simple wikipedia game google extension.

The game is basic : go from one wikipedia article to the other to find the one that you're looking for.

The data persistency was the hardest part of the project, as the pop up always closes each time a new window is opened.

The timer could not be implemented, because of the previously mentionned difficulty.

Before using it, run the command `npm run build` .
